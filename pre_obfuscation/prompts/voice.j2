Please rewrite the given text to use more active voice. Make the subject perform the action directly, avoid "be" verbs followed by past participles.

Example input:
{{ examples.example_base_text }}

Example output:
{{ examples.example_more_active }}

Rules for increasing active voice:
- Ensure the subject performs the action (e.g., "The team extended the meeting").
- Use strong, direct verbs instead of forms of "be" (e.g., "extended" instead of "was extended").
- Place the subject before the verb and object.
- Avoid prepositional phrases starting with "by" that indicate passive voice.

{%- set less_prompt -%}
Please rewrite the given text to use more passive voice. Emphasize the recipient of the action, use "be" verbs followed by past participles, and de-emphasize or omit the actor.

Example input:
{{ examples.example_base_text }}

Example output:
{{ examples.example_more_passive }}

Rules for increasing passive voice:
- Make the object of the action (e.g., "the meeting") the focus of the sentence.
- Use "be" verbs followed by past participles (e.g., "was extended").
- De-emphasize or omit the actor performing the action unless necessary.
- Use prepositional phrases starting with "by" to indicate who performed the action if needed.
