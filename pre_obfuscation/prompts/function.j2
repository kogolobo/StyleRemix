{%- set more_prompt -%}
Please rewrite the given text using more function words. Add articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and other connecting words to create a more detailed and flowing structure.

- Add conjunctions (e.g., "and," "but," "which") to connect ideas
- Use prepositions (e.g., "of," "in," "on") to provide additional context
- Avoid overly concise phrasing; aim for fluidity and detail

{%- endset -%}

{%- set less_prompt -%}
