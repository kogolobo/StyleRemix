Please rewrite the given text to make it more descriptive. Focus on creating vivid imagery, engaging the senses, and evoking emotion through precise and detailed language.

Example input:
{{ examples.example_base_text }}

Example output:
{{ examples.example_more_descriptive }}

Rules for increasing descriptiveness:
- Engage the senses: Include sensory details (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) to immerse the reader in the scene.
- Use figurative language: Incorporate similes, metaphors, and personification to create vivid comparisons and imagery.
- Choose precise language: Replace vague or generic words with specific and evocative terms.
- Establish a dominant impression: Craft a central mood or feeling that unifies the description (e.g., frustration, exhaustion).
- Add emotional texture: Use language that conveys feelings or atmosphere to deepen the reader’s experience.
- Organize carefully: Structure descriptions logically using spatial arrangement, chronological order, or order of importance.
- Show rather than tell: Paint a picture with words rather than stating facts directly.
